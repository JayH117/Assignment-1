# Assignment-1
My first assignment of 2nd year OOP
This assignment is to load the data of the annual sales of Spider-Man comic book series from when
it was first created in 1966 to the present day.
I will visualise this with a graph first and then another visualisation.
I have currently added background music and a background image.
I am yet to add a menu and methods of displaying the various menu options.
